## Overview

## Hardware Preparison

[D3-G](https://topst.ai/product/g/d3), an AI Single Board Computer, which has a 40-PIN pin header and compatible with Raspberry PI, so it has some SPI interfaces can be used.

Firstly, connecting the PIXPAPER-213-C's connector to the programming cable we've provided. Connect the other end of the cable to the corresponding pins, matching the colors as defined.

Then, connect to the D3-G specific PINs of 40-PIN header as follows:

## Driver Installation instructions

|Kernel|Tested|
|---|---|
| 5.10 |&#10004;|

Because there has a SPI interface on Linux already, so no need any tweaking in kernel space, just need to checking the device node is exist or not <br>

    ls /dev/spidev0.0
 

## User-Space Utility instructions (Linux OS)

Step 1. Install necessary packages

        Ubuntu/Debian:
        $ sudo apt install gpiod libgpiod-dev

        Yocto:
        Need add the line in machine conf file as following:
        IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " libgpiod"


Step 2. Prepare a 250x122 size picture what you want to showing, then make a image raw data based header file

        Download the PNG to RAW converter base on python3, remember to install opencv package first
        $ sudo apt install python3-opencv
        $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-EPD/user-space-examples/refs/heads/master/2.13/color/spi/png2epd.py

        Then, rename your PNG file as test.png, and excute the python script
        $ python3 png2epd.py

        It will generate a output file: png_HEX.h, the copy the same folder witth pixpaper-213-c-test-d3-g.c.
        Note that this step can running on host PC side or target board, but png_HEX.h must be put into the folder with c file together before 
        compiling.

        Download a sample header file:
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-EPD/user-space-examples/refs/heads/master/2.13/color/spi/png_HEX.h


Step 3. Please download the utility source code in the rootfs of D3-G SBC, then compile it and execute the compiled executable file.

        PIXPAPER-213-C:
        # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-EPD/user-space-examples/refs/heads/master/2.13/color/spi/pixpaper-213-c-test-d3-g.c
        # gcc -o epd_test pixpaper-213-c-test-d3-g.c -lgpiod
        # ./epd_test

        Note that if your wired connection is different with chapter 1 "Hardware Preparison", especially DC# PIN, RST# PIN, and BUSY PIN, also can issue command 'gpioinfo' to check the gpip pin detail. 
        Please modify the specific macros definition of pixpaper-213-c-test-d3-g.c:

        #define EPD_GPIO_CHIP "gpiochip4"
        #define EPD_DC_PIN 1
        #define EPD_RST_PIN 2
        #define EPD_BUSY_PIN 6


Expection results: <br>
