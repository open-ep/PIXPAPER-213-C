## Overview

## Hardware Preparison

[Raspberry PI 2 Model](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) is a very low-power ARM32 Cortex-A7 platform released in 2014. Even after 10 years, it remains a top choice for simple IoT applications and continues to be available on the official website. Its operating system is also actively maintained. If you’re looking for an energy-efficient and affordable solution, especially when paired with the PIXPAPER-213-C for simple applications, the Raspberry PI 2 is an excellent option.

To start, use the raspi-config command to open the configuration interface and enable SPI.
Note that our Raspberry Pi OS is based on the November 2024 release.


Firstly, connecting the PIXPAPER-213-C's connector to the programming cable we've provided. Connect the other end of the cable to the corresponding pins, matching the colors as defined.

Then, connect to the Raspberry PI specific PINs of 40-PIN header as follows:

## Driver Installation instructions

Raspberry PI OS can dynamic enable/disable SPI interface, no need tweak kernel source code.
Issue "rasp-config" command into the control GUI and following steps as below:

Step 1. Selecting **Interface Options** <br>

Step 5. Reboot the device and check spi device node is existed or not.

    ls /dev/spidev0.0
 

## User-Space Utility instructions (Linux OS)



Step 1. Install necessary packages

        Ubuntu/Debian:
        $ sudo apt install gpiod libgpiod-dev


Step 2. Prepare a 250x122 size picture what you want to showing, then make a image raw data based header file

        Download the PNG to RAW converter base on python3, remember to install opencv package first
        $ sudo apt install python3-opencv
        $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-EPD/user-space-examples/refs/heads/master/2.13/color/spi/png2epd.py

        Then, rename your PNG file as test.png, and excute the python script
        $ python3 png2epd.py

        It will generate a output file: png_HEX.h, the copy the same folder witth pixpaper-213-c-test-rpi2.c.
        Note that this step can running on host PC side or target board, but png_HEX.h must be put into the folder with c file together before 
        compiling.

        Download a sample header file:
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-EPD/user-space-examples/refs/heads/master/2.13/color/spi/png_HEX.h


Step 3. Please download the utility source code in the rootfs of Raspberry PI, then compile it and execute the compiled executable file.

        # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-EPD/user-space-examples/refs/heads/master/2.13/color/spi/pixpaper-213-c-test-rpi2.c
        # gcc -o epd_test pixpaper-213-c-test-rpi2.c -lgpiod
        # ./epd_test

        Note that if your wired connection is different with chapter 1 "Hardware Preparison", especially DC# PIN, RST# PIN, and BUSY PIN, also can issue command 'gpioinfo' to check the gpip pin detail. 
        Please modify the specific macros definition of pixpaper-213-c-test-rpi2.c:

        #define EPD_GPIO_CHIP "gpiochip0"
        #define EPD_DC_PIN 23
        #define EPD_RST_PIN 24
        #define EPD_BUSY_PIN 25


Expection results: <br>
